# nixos-config

For personal use

Public so I can easily clone it and so you can have a reference

## Info

My primary goal was creating something extremely simple while avoiding unecessary abstraction and indirection.

No Nix “footguns” used:
* NO overlays!
* NO importing from derivations!
* NO `with` usage!
* NO `rec` usage!
* NO stylix, home-manager, or any other janky dependencies!
* NO channels!
* NO flake-utils!
* NO impurities or imperative design!

All while remaining as functional and powerful as I need it to be.

## Credit

Any code that I found from someone else includes a clear header giving credit to them.

Any patching or customizing done to software was done clearly within the bounds of that software's license.
